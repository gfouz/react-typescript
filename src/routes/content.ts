frameworks such as React or Vue to create single page application
or full static sites so that among my skills are HTML, CSS, SCSS,
JavaScript and TypeScript. Besides i feel very comfortable with
some react technologies as styled-components, Material UI,
react-query, react-hook-form and NextJs and very soon i will be
learning about Deno that is a new technology on the server side,
and that includes TypeScript by default, even though this has to 
do nothing with React is very interesting for me.

Hello my name is Giovani Fouz and I am self taught web developer. I
also love English language and music so that when i have a time off i
enjoy listening to good English songs. I also like electronics and to
do interesting things on Arduino boards but it is true that time is
not  enough.  I  have  been working on cutting metal machine tools for
many many  years, and  have a good experience on it. I pretend to do
the   same   thing   with  programming,  and  i  have  a better reason
for accomplishing, i feel good when i am doing things on my laptop.
